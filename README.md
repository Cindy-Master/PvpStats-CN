Final Fantasy XIV Dalamud plugin for recording PvP match history. Currently only supports Crystalline Conflict, with future plans for Frontline and Rival Wings support.

## Usage Instructions
* Install from main repo with testing builds enabled.
* Matches are recorded automatically. There's no need to wait for the scoreboard to appear for it to be saved.
* Enter `/ccstats` to open the Crystalline Conflict stats window to browse matches and statistics.
* Enter `/pvpstatsconfig` or press the gear on the plugin description to access settings.

## Known Issues

## Feature Roadmap
May or may not eventually get implemented:
* Using Lodestone IDs to track stats across alias changes.
* Records and rank graph.
* Player details window.
* Frontline support.
* Rival Wings support.
* Chat log, kill feed, crystal progress tracking.
* Full combat tracking.
