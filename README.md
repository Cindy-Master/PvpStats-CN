# PvP Tracker

Final Fantasy XIV Dalamud plugin for recording PvP match history. Currently only supports Crystalline Conflict, with future plans for Frontline and Rival Wings support.

## Usage instructions
* Matchs are recorded automatically.
* Leaving a match before the results window displays will result in post-game statistics being unavailable. (Currently investigating whether this can be worked around).
* Enter `/ccstats` to open the Crystalline Conflict stats window.
